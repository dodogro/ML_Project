### Machine Learning  Project 2022/2023
The project deals with trying to find the best classification model to predict whether a tire is prone to failure or not. 
After a brief data-cleaning process, we have empirically tried to assess which model among many, such as KNN, Naive Bayesian Classifier, Neural Networks, 
Decisin Trees, SVM, and many others, is more suited for this job.
